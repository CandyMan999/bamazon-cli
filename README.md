# Node.js & MySQL



In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

This app runs in your command line.. to run this app make sure you have node installed on your computer. Then in the terminal run npm install.

You can start this app by running node + (the js filename of the department you want to run)

for example node BamazonManager.js will start the app for the manager section of the app
